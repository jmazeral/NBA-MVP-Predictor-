# NBA MVP Predictor
My first shot at machine learning using scikit was a success, hopefully I can apply some of this stuff in the future 

### What I Used:
- Jupyter Notebook for everything
- Requests for most of the web scraping done from basketball-reference, Selenium for the weird pages
- BeautifulSoup for parsing scraped HTML
- pandas for everything
- sklearn ridge regression model for training

### Possible Next Steps:
- apply the model to the 2024-25 season (more web scraping so fun)
- add more predictors to hopefully make the model more accurate

(This project was **heavily** inspired by [DataQuest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cn1nHlbFVw&ab_channel=Dataquest))
